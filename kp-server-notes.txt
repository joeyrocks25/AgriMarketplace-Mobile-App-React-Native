so the app must be hitting the right endpoint
 LOG  API Endpoint: http://192.168.1.130:9000/api/listings

and we know the server is correct because we can successfully send data through a curl post eg
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"title\": \"Example Listing\", \"price\": 99.99, \"categoryId\": 1, \"description\": \"This is an example listing\", \"location\": {\"latitude\": 37.7749, \"longitude\": -122.4194}}" http://localhost:9000/api/listings
{"id":9,"title":"Example Listing","price":99.99,"categoryId":1,"description":"This is an example listing","images":[],"location":{"latitude":37.7749,"longitude":-122.4194}}

We also can identify the connection is good because we're loading our listitem data

C:\Users\kpfb2>curl -X DELETE http://192.168.1.130:9000/api/listings/12
{"error":"Listing not found."}
C:\Users\kpfb2>curl http://192.168.1.130:9000/api/listings/12
{"error":"Listing not found."}
C:\Users\kpfb2>curl -X GET http://192.168.1.130:9000/api/listings


So why are we getting this error?

The error you're encountering indicates that the category object is undefined when attempting to access its value property. This error is likely occurring because the category field in your form is not being properly set or selected.

To fix this issue, you should ensure that the category field in your form is properly populated with a selected category value.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

    Double-check your form implementation and ensure that the category field is correctly set up with the appropriate name and items properties.

    Verify that the CategoryPickerItem component is properly rendering the category items with the correct values.

    Check if there are any other parts of your code that might be affecting the form's category field, such as additional event handlers or form manipulation.

By ensuring that the category field is correctly populated and its value is set when submitting the form, you should be able to resolve the TypeError you're currently encountering.
